# PyoMyo
## Python Open-source Myo library

This library is a fork of [dhzu/myo-raw.](https://github.com/dzhu/myo-raw)
Bug fixes from [Alvipe/myo-raw](https://github.com/Alvipe/myo-raw) were also added to stop crashes and also add essential features.  


This code was then updated to Python3.


**Note that sEMG data, the same kind gathered by the Myo is thought to be uniquely identifiable. Do not share this data without careful consideration of the future implications.**
